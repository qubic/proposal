## 1. Introduction

Pulse is a 6-digit lottery smart contract on Qubic. Each ticket holds six digits
in the range [0, 9]. Winning digits are also six draws from [0, 9], with
duplicates allowed. Payouts use fixed reward tables with a pro-rata fallback
when contract balance is insufficient. The contract enforces a QHeart balance
cap and sweeps excess to the QHeart issuer wallet.

### Key Features

- Fixed prize tables (left-aligned and any-position)
- Scheduled draws (default Wed/Fri/Sun at 11:00 UTC)
- Configurable fee split (dev, burn, shareholders, QHeart wallet)
- Pro-rata payouts under insufficient balance
- Auto-participation deposits and auto-purchasing
- QHeart balance cap with excess sweep

## 2. Game Mechanics

### Number Selection

- Ticket digits are six values in [0, 9].
- Duplicate digits are allowed.
- Any digit outside [0, 9] is rejected.

### Ticket Purchase

#### BuyTicket
1. Fails if selling is closed.
2. Validates digits are within range.
3. Fails if the round ticket cap (1,024) is reached.
4. Fails if the player does not have sufficient QHeart.
5. Transfers ticket price to the contract and records the ticket.

#### BuyRandomTickets
1. Fails if count is zero.
2. Fails if selling is closed.
3. Clamps purchase count to the remaining slots.
4. Fails if no slots remain.
5. Charges the player for the clamped count.
6. Allocates random digits for each ticket.

### Winning Criteria

For each ticket, the prize is the maximum of:
- **Left-aligned matches**: number of consecutive matches from index 0 until the first mismatch.
- **Any-position matches**: sum over digits of `min(ticketCount[d], winningCount[d])`.

Duplicates count toward matches based on multiplicity.

## 3. Auto Participation

### Overview

Users can deposit QHeart for automatic purchases. Each auto entry stores:
- `deposit` (QHeart reserved in the contract wallet)
- `desiredTickets` (number of tickets to buy per auto run)

The contract maintains a registry capped at 512 entries
(half of the ticket capacity).

### DepositAutoParticipation

- Rejects if registry is full.
- Rejects if `amount <= 0` or `desiredTickets <= 0`.
- Clamps `desiredTickets` to `maxAutoTicketsPerUser` when non-zero.
- Clamps `amount` to available user balance.
- Requires `amount >= ticketPrice * desiredTickets`.
- If `buyNow` and selling is open, buys immediately:
  - If the full amount is spent, no entry is created.
  - If any remainder exists, it is stored as a deposit entry.
- Otherwise, transfers deposit to the contract and stores/updates the entry.

### WithdrawAutoParticipation

- Rejects if no entry exists.
- If `amount <= 0`, withdraws the full deposit.
- Otherwise withdraws `min(amount, deposit)`.
- Removes entry if deposit becomes zero.

### SetAutoConfig

- `desiredTickets < -1` is invalid.
- `desiredTickets == -1` keeps the existing value.
- `desiredTickets > 0` sets a new value.

### SetAutoLimits

- Owner-only. Sets `maxAutoTicketsPerUser`.
- `0` disables the per-user limit.
- Values above the ticket cap are rejected.

### Auto Purchase Timing

Auto purchases can run:
- At `BEGIN_EPOCH` when selling is open (and not at the bootstrap sentinel).
- At `BEGIN_TICK`:
  - On first valid day after bootstrap to seed selling.
  - After a non-Wednesday draw when selling reopens.

Auto purchases are skipped when selling is closed or no slots remain.
Unaffordable entries are removed.

## 4. Revenue Distribution

Ticket revenue is split by configured percentages:
- Dev
- Burn
- Shareholders
- QHeart wallet
- Remainder retained in the contract for prizes

**Defaults:**
- Dev: 10%
- Burn: 5%
- Shareholders: 5%
- QHeart wallet: 5%

The sum of percentages must be <= 100.

Shareholder rewards are distributed pro-rata to PULSE share holders.

## 5. Prize Structure

### Left-Aligned Reward Table

| Matches | Reward |
|---------|--------|
| 6 | 2000 x ticket price |
| 5 | 300 x ticket price |
| 4 | 60 x ticket price |
| 3 | 20 x ticket price |
| 2 | 4 x ticket price |
| 1 | 1 x ticket price |
| 0 | 0 |

### Any-Position Reward Table

| Matches | Reward |
|---------|--------|
| 6 | 150 x ticket price |
| 5 | 30 x ticket price |
| 4 | 8 x ticket price |
| 3 | 2 x ticket price |
| 2 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 |

### Payout Rule

For each ticket:
```
prize = max(leftAlignedReward, anyPositionReward)
```

If the contract balance is insufficient to pay all prizes:
```
scaledPrize = floor(prize * availableBalance / totalPrize)
```

---

## 6. Settlement Process

Settlement is triggered during `BEGIN_TICK` when:
1. Current hour >= draw hour
2. Day is Wednesday, or matches the configured schedule bitmask
3. The date differs from the last draw date

### Settlement Steps

1. If no tickets sold, return.
2. Compute round revenue: `ticketPrice * ticketCounter`.
3. Transfer fees (dev, burn, shareholders, QHeart wallet).
4. Generate six winning digits from the previous spectrum digest.
5. Compute total prize across all tickets.
6. Pay prizes (full or pro-rata).
7. Update winners ring buffer.
8. Sweep excess balance above `qheartHoldLimit` to the QHeart wallet.
9. Clear tickets and close the round.
10. Reopen selling after non-Wednesday draws and run auto-purchases.

---

## 7. Admin Controls and Configuration

All admin procedures are owner-only (QHeart issuer) and apply at `END_EPOCH`:

- `SetPrice(newPrice)` (must be > 0)
- `SetSchedule(newSchedule)` (bitmask, must be non-zero)
- `SetDrawHour(newDrawHour)` (0-23)
- `SetFees(dev, burn, shareholders, qheart)` (sum <= 100)
- `SetQHeartHoldLimit(newLimit)`
- `SetAutoLimits(maxTicketsPerUser)`

Default configuration:
- Ticket price: 200,000 QHeart
- Draw hour: 11:00 UTC
- Schedule: Wednesday, Friday, Sunday
- Hold limit: 2,000,000,000 QHeart
- Auto limit: 1,024 tickets per user
