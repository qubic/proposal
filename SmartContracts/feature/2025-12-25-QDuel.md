QDuel Contract Proposal

# Proposal

## Available Options

Option 0: No, do not upgrade the contract.

Option 1: Yes, approve the upgrade to enable multi-asset functionality.

## Overview
QDuel is a simple duel game contract where two players stake equal amounts,
and the winner receives the pooled amount minus configured fees. The contract
creates and manages duel rooms, handles winner selection, and distributes fees
to the team address, burn, and Random Lottery shareholders.

## Motivation and Goals
- Provide a lightweight, on-chain duel mechanic with minimal state.
- Ensure fair settlement with deterministic winner selection.
- Refund funds if a duel does not resolve in time.
- Allow the team to tune fees and room TTL without redeploying.

## Contract Summary
The contract maintains up to 512 active rooms. A room stores:
roomId, player1, optional allowedPlayer, amount, and creation timestamp.
Players interact through CreateRoom and ConnectToRoom. If a room expires before
it is joined, funds are returned to player1. All rooms are cleared at epoch end.

## Current Fee Settings (from QDuel.h defaults)
- devFeePercent = 0.15%
- burnFeePercent = 0.30%
- shareholdersFeePercent = 0.55%
- total = 1%

Shareholders fee is distributed to holders of the Random Lottery asset
(asset name RL). Distribution is proportional to shares owned at payout time.
Any remainder from integer division is burned.

## Winner Selection
Winner is derived from the previous spectrum digest mixed with both player IDs
and the current tick, hashed via K12. The least significant bit selects either
the min or max player ID. This is deterministic and verifiable on-chain.

## Example Duel Settlement
- Room amount: 100,000 QU from player1 and 100,000 QU from player2.
- Total pot: 200,000 QU.
- Fees at default settings:
  - devFee: 200,000 * 0.15% = 300 QU
  - burnFee: 200,000 * 0.30% = 600 QU
  - shareholdersFee: 200,000 * 0.55% = 1,100 QU
- Winner payout: 200,000 - (300 + 600 + 1,100) = 198,000 QU.
- Shareholders fee is split across RL holders; any remainder is burned.

## Lifecycle Management
- END_TICK (every 10 ticks): refund expired rooms based on TTL hours.
- END_EPOCH: refund all open rooms and reset storage.
