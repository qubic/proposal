# Proposal to Fund the Security Audit of the iOS and Android Wallet applications

## Proposal
Send X Billion Qubic to the Address `TBC` to fund a Security Audit of the Mobile Wallet Apps

> Option 0: No

> Option 1: Yes, X Billion Qubic

## Overview

Weâ€™re moving forward with an important step to improve the security of our iOS and Android wallet applications by conducting a professional audit.
This would be the first-ever external security audit for our mobile apps. Until now, no formal review has been conducted.

## Why Now?

We have developed new important features â€” such as the in-app mobile browser and connection to test networks â€” that are not yet live in production and they increase the appâ€™s complexity and potential attack surface.

Additionally, community members have previously asked important questions about the mobile walletâ€™s security, including concerns like:

- How secure is the wallet app overall?  
- Is there any risk of private keys being stolen?  
- How safe is using WalletConnect with the wallet?

Given these concerns and upcoming changes, we believe this is the right time for a proactive, professional security audit.

## What We Did

We contacted several reputable security firms and received six proposals, each offering different audit types, timelines, and pricing. Below is a summary of the offers.

Offers a strong balance of quality, professionalism, and cost.  
- Senior engineers per platform  
- White-box approach  
- Reputable team in blockchain security  
- Fast and reasonably priced (~$17.5k USD)

ðŸ”¹ Alternative â€“ Option 4: 
If visibility and community engagement are important, this option includes:  
- Internal + community review layers  
- Marketing support  
- Slightly higher price ($20.8k), but may be justified by outreach value
