# Proposal to Fund the Formation and activites of QDS (Qubic Development Services)

## Proposal
Send 300 billion QUBIC to the identity `VJQECJESERFUWCRAGWTZRIFXMRLDBYUYBOYTKCTLJHEOFSRGHDBEATVCTBZI` to support the formation, development, activities and products of QDS.

> Option 0: no

> Option 1: yes, 134 billion QUBIC


## How We Used Past Funding

- This is a newly formed entity establishing a new method to drive user activity and development on the Qubic network.
This group has never been funded, is newly formed, is comprised of previous Qubic and external entities.

## Overview

We are requesting 143 billion QUBIC to support the development of the Qubic Development Services team.  This team has been formed in service of a very distinct mission; to drive developer tooling and paid engagements on the Qubic network.  The requested funding will be used to fund development activities, drive business development, market QDS and establish meaningful business relationships. The funding amount was calculated using a valuation of 1400 USDT per billion (200K).  Taking into account volatility and current market confidence, we are valuating the value of the token higher than current market rate as this will roll over a 3 month projection period with a unique treasury management approach.

The requested funding will be allocated to:
- The 134 billion will be locked in Qearn for 3 full months (May, June & July).
- Upon completion of necessary team artifacts and products (smart indexer, smart contract IDE, business partnerships and full marketing campaigns) a slow month by month withdrawal of funds will occur to cover previous owed salaries and any absorbed expenses.

# Why will funding be handled this way?  
First of all no payment is taken until the base products are released to ecosystem partners and users giving a head start on ramp up activities before the network will bear the brunt of the cost.  By locking the tokens they are being removed from circulation triggering a large signal to the community and investors at large that circulation is shrinking.  This move will also allow interest to be collected to support small activities while also further pulling tokens out of circulation into a Qearn wallet.  Withdrawal sequence is as follows:

- In August one month of retroactive expenses (salaries and other operational expenses, roughly 1/3 of staked amount is withdrawn) for May services.
- In September the next month of expenses are drawn against retroactive June services and salaries.
- In October the next month of expenses are drawn against retroactive July services and salaries.

In the event the token price exceeds our valuation (along with earned interest) the remainder will be cycled back in the QDS budget to kickoff the next quarter of activities and remain locked in Qearn.  If the token valuation doesn't reach the valuation specified value the delta is consumed by the team in the form of free labor.  This arrangement allows a quarter lead time for computors to absorb the labor and products before a follow-on funding request that would follow in 3 months.  In the event a follow-on proposal is rejected this also provides 3 months of run-rate for the network to recover as salaries are deferred not causing imminent gridlock and allowing another entity time to carry forward the work started by the QDS team.  This release of funds also is strategically well aligned with the Qubic halving event scheduled for this summer.

The goal of the group is to slowly over time reduce the need for CCF funding by cultivating and tapping into external relationships.  As external paid engagement grows for services (software development, go to market or business development activities) to bootstrap or accelerate external partnerships the reliance on CCF funding will decrease.  The goal is to be nearly self funded via these relationships in roughly 24 to 36 months while showing a decrease in a need for CCF funding during this time period.  This will also create a blueprint for entities to build fully functional businesses and ecosystems on top of the Qubic network.  To reinforce the commitment to Qubic all services external or internal shall be paid in Qubic increasing buy pressure and reducing circulating supply organically.

Our token valuation is based on the following ideology:
- By removing a large swath of tokens from circulation it is a great market signal
- Another market signal is the formation of a group with a sole mission to make Qubic consumable for enterprise and research
- Encapsulating all planned related activities from marketing to development in one compact proposal makes it easy for the network to consume while building a focused team with a specific purpose.
- Further accelerating burns through interaction and usage of Qearn SC and newly generated SCs

### Provided Services / What QDS does
- Drive developer engagement by attempting to tap into a global talent pool in multiple disciplines.
- Build three key products (smart indexer and smart contract IDE) to make development more seamless.
- Allocates a small business development team to pursue academic and research engagement by pushing these tools externally.
- Use same small business development team to drive web3 initiatives with entities like w3.io looking to increase enterprise engagement and use leveraging web3 ecosystems.
- Establish new development paradigms and drive use of testnet and mainnet.
- Encourage easier development of smart contracts through tooling, increasing burns, IPOs and opening new found opportunities external to traditional siloed ecosystem entities.
- Maintains all software developed by Qubic Development Services.
- Produces clear documentation explaining how the software works, how to use it, and the logic behind it—both in code comments and external guides
- Provides technical support and platform access to other ecosystem builders building on top of Qubic.
- Drive more dapp development on top of smart indexer and increase usage of the Qubic ecosystem.
- Adjacent documentation and educational artifacts to assist developers of different disciplines such as:  C++ devs for smart contracts, dapp devs for smart indexer (smart indexer will allow SQL quality searches over RPC data).
- Provide business development and marketing assistance to other teams within Qubic (depending on engagement level without fees).  In the event more than 10 hours per week are needed an agreed upon contract rate must be paid in Qubic only to help drive buy pressure.

It’s also important to clarify what we do not lead, handle, or take responsibility for:
- Anything external to QDS products, business development or marketing services unless its a paid engagement.</br>

### Maintained Products/Software
- Qubic Smart Contract IDE
- Solana Bridge for Qubic
- Qubic Smart Indexer for RPC data
- Qubic Developer Services Business Development Team
- Qubic Developer Services Marketing Team

>[!NOTE] 
> - Current team members are engaged through various arrangements: some are employed via different companies, others are independent contractors or volunteers.</br>
> - Team members may work full-time or be compensated on an hourly basis.  In the event an employee is hourly an audit record of hours worked will be provided to ensure market rate is not violated.</br>
> - Salaries are paid strictly in QUBIC.</br>
> - Development, go to market and business development services from QDS can be leveraged by a variety of ecosystem teams, a total of 10 free hours per week can be offered for each.  In the event more is required the contracting team can pay the overage to QDS based on a contracted hourly rate which will contribute to the QDS fund. <br>

## Governance
- Any unspent funds are to be left in Qearn staking and used for any activities that can be funded post 7/31 to bootstrap next funding round.
- @pegasus-schreck will receive the funds upon approval of the proposal and will be responsible for reporting all expenditures.
- To ensure transparency and proper management of CCF funds, the Qubic Developer Services team will grant the CCF and/or an independent community team access to all relevant documentation, including salary details, service invoices, and transaction history.
- Bonuses (in the event of increased token price only) may be paid to an employee or entity in the event that scheduled tasks or milestones are completed ahead of schedule.
