# **Proposal: Global Deployment of Lite + Bob Nodes to Strengthen Qubic Network Infrastructure**

## Proposal
Send **18 Billion Qubic** (~18,000 USD at $1,000 per billion)) to the address `QCTBOBEPDEZGBBCSOWGBYCAIZESDMEVRGLWVNBZAPBIZYEJFFZSPPIVGSCVL` to fund Lite+Bob global deployment

> Option 0: No  

> Option 1: Yes, send 18 Billion Qubic to fund Lite+Bob global deployment


## **Overview**
We have successfully completed and stabilized the implementation of **Lite Nodes** and the **Bob MVP**. Both have operated reliably for **two consecutive epochs**, confirming their readiness for global deployment.  

This proposal seeks CCF funding to expand the infrastructure worldwide — deploying **Lite + Bob nodes** on 20 machines — to enhance **network coverage, reliability, and accessibility** for developers and ecosystem participants.

---

## **Background**
- **Lite Nodes** are lightweight node in the Qubic network that maintain core functionality with reduced hardware requirements, making them ideal for decentralized scaling.  
- **Bob Nodes** serve as **data indexers and API providers**, fetching on-chain data and storing it in a structured database. This enables **smart contract developers and third-party services** to easily query Qubic’s on-chain data.  
- Together, Lite + Bob form an essential foundation for developer tooling and ecosystem growth — improving accessibility to the Qubic network’s data layer.  

Both systems have now proven **operational stability** across multiple epochs, validating the technical foundation for a global rollout.

---

## **Phase 1: Global Node Deployment**

We propose renting and maintaining **20 machines** for **1 year**, each running both **Lite** and **Bob** components to maximize resource efficiency and improve network coverage.

| Region | Machines | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **EU** | 4 | Enhance latency and reliability for European nodes |
| **US** | 6 | Strengthen presence across North America |
| **Asia** | 10 | Support the fast-growing Asian developer and user base |

---

## **Node Specifications**

We are using the following hardware configuration for each machine to ensure optimal performance and future scalability:

- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen™ 7 7700  
- **RAM:** 64 GB DDR5  
- **Storage:** 2× 1 TB NVMe SSD (Gen4)

## **Budget Breakdown (From A Popular Germany Provider)**

| Item | Cost (USD) | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Machine rental per node | $70/month | Includes compute, bandwidth, and storage |
| Annual cost per machine | $840 | 12 months × $70 |
| Once-off setup          | $44/machine  | 20 machines x $44
| **Total (20 machines)** | **$17,680 (18B)** | For one year of operation |

---

## **Goals & Deliverables**

1. **Maintain >99% uptime** via distributed monitoring and automatic failover.  
2. **Publish Bob API endpoints** for developers to access Qubic on-chain data easily.  
3. **Provide quarterly transparency reports** on uptime, performance, and network coverage.  
4. **Gather developer feedback** to refine the data indexing and query layer.  

---

## **Expected Impact**

- **Improved global coverage** for the Qubic network, reducing latency and single-region dependence. Especially **exchanges** that need higher quality access to qubic nodes. 
- **Enhanced developer experience** with reliable, structured access to on-chain data.  
- **Greater decentralization** through distributed infrastructure.  
- **Foundation for future scaling (Phase 2)** with more regions, redundancy, and data analytics extensions.  

---

## **Conclusion**
After demonstrating stability across multiple epochs, **Lite and Bob** are ready for global deployment.  
This **Phase 1 rollout** will strengthen Qubic’s infrastructure, improve accessibility for developers, and advance the ecosystem’s decentralization.  

We respectfully request **community funding of 18B QUBIC** to support this one-year initiative,  
while remaining **open to cheaper solutions** and **committed to returning any surplus** to the **CCF** if more cost-efficient options are found.
