# !DRAFT! Proposal to Fund the Development of the Qubic Core

## Proposal
Send 180 billion QUBIC (roughly 288'000 USD @1600$/bln) to the address `YYY` to support the further development of Qubic Core.

> Option 0: no

> Option 1: yes, 180 billion QUBIC

## Overview
We are asking for 180 billion QUBIC for the further development of the Qubic Core. This Budget is to secure the runway for the next three months (November 2024 - January 2025).
This funding secures that Qubic can grow. It allowes the developers to continue their work on Qubic.

### Provided Servives / What we do
- Builds the Qubic Core / Qubic Network (protocol)
- Dedicates ~1FTE* to build Smart Contracts (help others, review code)
- Builds and Operates the Qubic Integration Layer (used by Wallets, Exchanges and others to access Qubic)
- Operates the Qubic Test Net
- Takes responsibility to maintain the Qubic Core/Integration Release/Versioning
- Maintains the software created by Qubic Core Technology
- Writes documentation how the developed software can to be used and what is the logic behind (in code and written elsewhere)
- Supports other ecosystem builders to build on top of Qubic

### Maintained Products/Software
- Qubic Main Net (Software)
- Qubic Test Net
- Qubic RPC/API Infrastructure
- Qubic General Tech Support
- Qubic Smart Contract integration support
- Qubic Core (https://github.com/qubic/core)
- Qubic CLI (https://github.com/qubic/qubic-cli)
- Qubic Archiver (https://github.com/qubic/go-archiver)
- Qubic Events (https://github.com/qubic/go-events)
- Qubic TS Library (https://github.com/qubic/ts-library)
- And many small tools around Qubic Core

Details to the organizational structure are described [here](https://github.com/J0ET0M/qubic-doc/blob/main/QubicCoreTechnologyDraft.md)

## Success Indicators
- the Qubic network is in a stable state
- bugs are fixed in an appropriate time
- development is documented (https://github.com/orgs/qubic/projects/1/views/7) any member of the Qubic community can see who is working on what
- once a month (November, December, January) someone from the Qubic Core Team holds an AMA/Presentation
- tech updates are given regularly inside of the Qubic Discord server
- the dev's are available for questions of the community and help ecosystem developers to onboard
- every repository maintained by the Qubic Core Team has a proper desciption and a manual on how to clone/compile/run the project

## Cost Break Down
Each month costs:
- ~2'000$ for servers, test environment and what's currently needed to operate
- ~94'000$ for salaries (excl. cfb and j0et0m; [The People](https://github.com/J0ET0M/qubic-doc/blob/main/QubicCoreTechnologyDraft.md#the-people-behind))

## Spending
The amount will be allocated to:
- Salaries
- Operating Infrastructure (e.g. cloud servers, test servers)


## Gouvernance
- Any funds unspent (eg. because of appreciation of the price of QUBIC) will either be returned to the CCF or taken to extend for the next period.
- @j0et0m will receive the funds if the proposal is accepted and report the spendings
- To ensure appropriate spending and management of the CCF funds, the Qubic Core Technology team will grant an independent community team access to all relevant documentation (e.g., salaries, expenditures).
- Initially, we have agreed that @lex will be part of this auditing layer. An additional person will be recruited to form a tandem team in this role.
