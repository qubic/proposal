# Qubic proposals
Repository to document Qubic proposals.

In the Qubic ecosystem we work with proposals to ask the Computors or others for their votes. This ensures a decentralized decision process.
There are several types 

## Computor proposals
Computor proposals are needed if something should be changed on the protocol or if you want to add a new SC to Qubic.

Sample use cases:
- Request to allow a new SC
- Extend protocol features

## Computor Donation proposal
This proposal is used to ask the Computors for a relative donation to what they earn per epoch.

Sample use cases:
- Ask to burn Qubics
- Ask to fund the CCF
- Ask to donate a long term project


## Shareholder proposal
A shareholder proposal is used to ask the shareholders of smart contracts for their votings.

Sample use cases:
- Adjust fees of a SC
- Change revenue address of a SC

## CCF Funding Request
If you have a project idea and want that the Qubic ecosystem fund (CCF) will help you to build it, then, this is the right place.

Sample use cases:
- Core Development needs funds to pay salaries
- Company X want's to integrate Qubic in their wallet
- The Grants program needs funds for their grants
