## Title
**AI-Driven Functional Health Assessment Protocol Integrating Walsh Biotypes and Qubic Infrastructure**

## Summary
This proposal seeks funding to develop and deploy an AI-based health assessment platform that integrates the Walsh Protocol—a research-driven model for identifying biochemical imbalances underlying mood and behavioral disorders—with Qubic’s decentralized AI and validation framework. The system is designed to offer a scalable, automated clinical decision tool that can triage users based on symptoms, lab values, and functional medicine history.

## Value to the Qubic Ecosystem
This project brings real-world utility to Qubic by demonstrating:
- A medical-grade use case powered by AI agents.
- Valuable human-labeled data (symptoms, labs, behavioral patterns) for future decentralized models.
- A HIPAA-compliant, clinical-grade decision tool that can operate fully or partially on-chain.

It directly supports Qubic’s mission by:
- Deploying decentralized intelligence for high-impact public health issues.
- Seeding a medical knowledge layer for use by other agents and users.
- Bridging Qubic with functional medical data that is otherwise inaccessible to legacy AI models.

## Description
This project builds a 3-tiered application using Qubic:

**Tier 1: Symptom-Based AI Intake Tool**
- No email or PII required.
- Auto-triages based on Walsh biotypes.
- Suggests preliminary biotype categories and encourages follow-up.

**Tier 2: Lab-Integrated Functional Evaluation**
- Auto-triage plus users input their lab values (manual or via API).
- Assessment refined using Walsh-informed logic + custom lab rules.

**Tier 3: Physician-Led AI Augmented Report**
- Full report reviewed by a Walsh-trained physician.
- Includes recommendations and supplement plan.

Platform will integrate with:
- **SecondOpinionPhysician.com** and **BiotypeNutrients.com**
- AI logic trained on 35+ years of functional medicine practice
- Walsh Protocol data structure for high-quality input normalization

## Behavioral Biotype Examples

### **Undermethylation**
Associated with:
- Chronic depression, OCD, high inner tension, addictive personality
- Oppositional defiance in children, high libido
- Competitiveness in sports, above average academic performance
- Seasonal allergies

Lab correlations:
- Elevated whole blood histamine
- Low plasma methionine and SAM
- High SAH

### **Copper Overload**
Associated with:
- High anxiety, ADHD, insomnia, postpartum depression, chronic fatigue
- Obesity in women, poor sleep-wake cycle, history of IUD or copper piping exposure

Lab correlations:
- Low zinc, high total copper, high free copper

### **Pyrrole Disorder (Mauve Factor)**
Associated with:
- ADHD, social withdrawal, poor dream recall, erratic sleep pattern, sensory sensitivity, anxiety
- Fine facial features, white cloud spots in nail beds, poor school performance, inflammation
- Sensitivity to metals, trauma response

Lab correlations:
- High urine pyrroles
- Low B6, low zinc, elevated copper

## Broader Relevance
This model targets millions of individuals suffering from mood disorders with minimal improvement from standard medications. By identifying the *biochemical root causes* using signs, symptoms, and accessible labs, this system empowers:
- Physicians with better decision support tools
- Individuals with insights to avoid trial-and-error treatments

## Grant Request
We are requesting **5,000,000,000 ($13,250) QUBIC** to cover development, deployment, and early user incentives.

Funds will support:
- AI development and Qubic integration
- Data structuring and anonymized training for validators
- Early UI/UX and triage logic

## Notes
- The Walsh Protocol is based on analysis of 30,000+ patients and differs from conventional psychiatry by correlating nutrient imbalances to mood and behavior with actionable interventions.
- There are 5 primary biotypes in the Walsh Protocol; this proposal outlines 3 with examples.
- Lab ranges used are based on Walsh’s research, not general population lab norms.
