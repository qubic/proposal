# Reallocate 55% of Weekly Emissions to the SupplyWatcher (Burn) starting from Epoch 175

As documented and prepared in 2024, the Qubic emission/supply schdule foresees a halving in EP175.

## Proposal
Allow adjustment of the Computor Donation for the SupplyWatcher (burn).

---

## Voting Options

- **Option 0:** No, I don't want
- **Option 1:** Yes, adjust computor donation in EP175 (Approve Halving at Epoch 175 that reduces half of effective emissions)

---

## 	Summary

This proposal recommends cutting Qubic’s weekly emissions in half at Epoch 175 to keep us on track with the long-term emission schedule and avoid running out of Qus too early ([Blog Post](https://qubic.org/blog-detail/qubic-s-revolutionary-tokenomics-and-halvings)).
We’re currently ahead of schedule, and delaying this halving risks ending emissions years before key deflationary developments like Aigarth are ready.

##  Considerations

Should the halving not happen now, the max supply may be reached within the next 50-70 weeks.
Reaching max supply within 2026 puts Qubic and future ecosystem projects at risk and shortens the timeline for everyone.

Tokens locked in QEarn (TVL) are counted toward circulating supply. They can re-enter the market at any time.
Halving emissions now helps keep emissions going longer and gives the project more time to grow.

### Post-Halving Expectation

| **Category**         | **Current** | **After Halving** |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Weekly Emissions     | 1000B       | 1000B (same)      |
| Maximum Weekly Burn          | 100B        | 550B              |
| Effective Emissions  | 900B        | 450B              |
| CCF Share (8%)       | 72B         | 36B               |
| QEarn Share (12.25%) | 101B        | 50.7B             |
| Minimum Mineable Supply     | 726.5B      | 363.3B            |

### Response To Common Objections

**Other comments:**

1. “Halving reduces miner rewards, and we don’t have real-world use cases yet.”
- The [SupplyWatcher](https://qubic.org/blog-detail/the-new-emission-model-proposal-with-80-supply-cut) smart contract already protects against excessive burns, but nothing limits over-inflation of circulating supply.

2. "Miners will leave"
- There’s plenty of extra compute right now. The proposed halving burns 5x more per week than extra mining with Tari or XMR.

3. "We do not have a true real-world use case"
- Without a change, emissions will run out in about 55 weeks. Aigarth needs another 2 years. Acting now protects long-term projects.

4. "QEarn donation should not be cutted"
- Projects such as QEarn can always request an increase in funding after halving, but the procedure of halving should be very consistent, fair and predictable.

### Reminders

Any adjustment of the donation to the SupplyWatcher (burn) is subject to Computors voting. Any Computor may request future adjustments again.
