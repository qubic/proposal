## Details
Following the successful approval of our [new emission model](https://qubic.org/blog-detail/the-new-emission-model-proposal-with-80-supply-cut), we are excited to present another proposal aimed at benefiting both the immediate and long-term future of the Qubic ecosystem. The CCF (Computor Controlled Fund) has enabled many achievements - now, to drive even greater impact, **we're proposing to reallocate 8% of weekly emissions to the fund**.

### **A Quick Recap: What is the CCF?**
The [CCF](https://qubic.org/blog-detail/introducing-ccf-the-funding-element-of-project-x) (Computor Controlled Fund) is Qubic’s financial runway and the treasury which funds our activities.

The computors control this fund, which was initially filled in the early days of Qubic with approximately 1.18 trillion QUBIC. It [currently holds](https://explorer.qubic.org/network/address/VVEVMFGZWMFXNDIZCKHBSMHHJZUCKKDAGLVPGOPGNBTFDFYYNFYQFJGBIWGF) around 605 billion QUBIC, though 250 billion of this amount should be subtracted, as it has been reserved for market maker funds, most of which have already been spent.

We aim to sustainably fund the CCF by reallocating 8% of the weekly emissions directly to it. These emissions will enable the CCF to continue to support growing initiatives within our ecosystem, while building a treasury that extends our financial runway.

An important note: **No single entity has access to the CCF funds, nor can decide on how they are used.** With the [deployment of the CCF Smart Contract](https://github.com/qubic/proposal/blob/2e25df383dc95b937a3e0c56d11925b664770108/SmartContracts/2024-09-09-CCF.md) recently, the handling of funds is fully decentralised and automated via a smart contract. Only if the Quorum of computors decides in favour of a funding request, the funds will be released.

### **How is the CCF Utilised and What Do We Want to Achieve?**
We propose using the CCF to help develop the best AI infrastructure for builders, attracting the most talented developers and builders to our ecosystem, while ensuring the long-term financial health of Qubic.

Here’s how the allocated funds from the CCF have been, or will be, deployed across the following six key areas:

##### **Marketing**
The CCF will be used to increase our brand presence and establish Qubic as the premier AI blockchain project.

We’ve partnered with one of the leading Communications / PR agencies in the world to implement a winning communication strategy. This partnership will connect us with influential journalists and media outlets, both within and beyond the crypto space.

Additionally, we’ll use CCF funds to run educational marketing campaigns aimed at making Qubic more accessible to new holders, partners, institutions, and miners.

##### **Development**
Our tech team, consisting of 14 skilled professionals including developers, project managers, and designers, drive Qubic’s innovation. They’ve been responsible for building the core tech, as well as an integration layer for third parties, and have developed front end solutions for our users.

CCF funds are essential for completing our tech roadmap, paying for infrastructure and tooling, and for recruiting top talent.

##### **Ecosystem**
We use the CCF to fuel the growth of our ecosystem through grants, hackathons, partnerships with both crypto and traditional sectors, and exchange listings.

If 25% of CCF funds are allocated to the [Grants Program](https://qubic.org/blog-detail/introducing-the-qubic-grants-program), this would amount to 80 billion QUBIC or $160,000 per month (at $2,000 per billion QUBIC), totaling approximately $2 million annually. There is also potential for growth depending on any increase in the price of QUBIC. We see the Grants Program as instrumental to the success of a fast-growing ecosystem as it aims to support the development of high-quality smart contracts and solutions.

##### **Community**
Creating an active and engaged community is essential for Qubic’s success. We use CCF funds to cultivate an engaging community across our social channels through games, campaigns, and written content.

As a community-driven project, we encourage everyone to share their ideas. Have an idea? No problem! Simply ask the computors for funding. Every community member has the opportunity to pitch their idea and potentially secure funding.

##### **Operations**
We use CCF funds to strengthen our organisational structure, covering salaries for our 31 full-time and part-time employees and advisors

With around 50 team members in total currently working on Qubic, the fund also supports legal expenses and other operational costs, ensuring our team can continue innovating without financial constraints.

Additionally, the CCF helps us attract top talent and retain our best employees.

##### **Reserves**
To secure Qubic’s future, the CCF will also act as a long-term reserve, providing at least a three-year runway. This reserve is crucial for funding the development of Qubic, especially as we navigate potential market downturns, such as bear markets.

## **Our Proposal**
We’re excited to share our proposal to reallocate **8% of weekly emissions to the CCF.** This fund is crucial for ensuring our continued growth and innovation.

#### **What Does This Mean?**
We’re asking miners and computors to support this 8% reallocation. By redirecting a percentage of the emissions, we can better support projects and initiatives that will help Qubic thrive. It’s about investing in the long-term success of our ecosystem..

#### **Flexibility for the Future**
Market conditions change, and accordingly, so does the value of emissions. Our proposal therefore includes the possibility of adjusting this percentage. If price rises significantly, the 8% could be reduced to ensure that everyone’s contributions remain fair and sustainable.
