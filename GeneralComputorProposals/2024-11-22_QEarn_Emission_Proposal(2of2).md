# QEarn Proposal (2/2): Allocate Approximately 100B QU from Weekly Emission to QEarn

## Summary  
This proposal requests an allocation of approximately 100B QU tokens from the adjusted weekly emissions (after Burn adjustment) to fund QEarn. This allocation supports the recently approved QEarn smart contract and ensures sufficient rewards to make QEarn one of the most attractive locking/staking offers in the market.

## Available Options  
>Option 0: Yes, allow  
>Option 1: No  

## Rationale  
With the reduction in the burn rate from 15% to 10%, as proposed in Proposal (1/2), approximately 50B QU tokens will become available for reallocation. Additionally, the system will adjust the reward structure to provide the remaining portion of the approximately 100B QU from emissions, ensuring the necessary funding for QEarn.

## Calculation Breakdown  
- *Starting Weekly Emission:* 1000B QU  
- *Arbitrator (approx. 2%):* 1000B - 2% = 980B  
- *Burn Adjustment (10%):* 980B - 10% = 882B  
- *Computor Controlled Funds (CCF) 8%:* 882B – 8% = 811.44B  
- *QEarn Allocation (Approx. 12.25% - ~46B from burn (5.63%) and ~54B from emission (6.615%)):* 811.44B – 12.25% = 711.22B  

This ensures that approximately 100B QU tokens are available weekly to fund QEarn.

## Impact  
- **Support for QEarn:**  
  Allocating 100B QU per week ensures sufficient rewards for participants, fostering long-term engagement and circulating supply reduction.  

- **Efficient Use of Emissions:**  
  This reallocation balances deflationary pressures with ecosystem growth, driving demand and value for the QU token.  

## Implementation  
If approved, the allocation will take effect in the next epoch, with the reward pool for QEarn receiving approximately 100B QU tokens weekly.

## KPI-Driven Success Measurement  
To ensure the effectiveness of QEarn and its contribution to the Qubic ecosystem, the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be used to measure its impact:

1. **Total Locked Supply**  
   - The total amount of `$QUBIC` locked through QEarn will be monitored to assess how much circulating supply is being reduced.  

2. **Weekly Locked Average**  
   - The average amount of `$QUBIC` locked each week will provide insights into user adoption and engagement with QEarn over time.  

3. **Average Locked Per Address**  
   - Tracking the average amount locked per participating address will help identify the level of individual commitment and balance.  

4. **Influence on Exchange Balances**  
   - Monitoring `$QUBIC` balances on exchanges can provide a direct measure of how QEarn is impacting liquid supply. A reduction in exchange balances signals reduced sell pressure and increased long-term holding.  

This will ensure Quorum has metrics to assess the benefits of QEarn at any moment.
