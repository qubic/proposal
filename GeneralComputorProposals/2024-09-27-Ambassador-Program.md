## Details
The Qubic Ambassador Program is a global initiative aimed at building local communities passionate about Qubic’s decentralised solutions. Qubican’s (ambassadors) will lead on expanding Qubic’s global reach by organising local events, educating local communities, and contributing to the growth of the ecosystem by completing tasks and bounties. In order to build the right infrastructure and create incentives for talent to join the program, we’re proposing a request to fund the ambassador program with 8Bln QUBIC.

### What will Qubic Ambassadors do
- Qubic Ambassadors (Qubicans) are passionate individuals from around the globe to help grow Qubic. There are four distinct types of ambassador roles, each contributing to the ecosystem in a unique way:
- Qubican Community Leaders – Lead and organise local meetups, conferences, workshops, and virtual events to engage and expand Qubic's presence in your area.
- Qubican Content Creators – Create educational materials such as videos, blog posts, and social media content to raise awareness about Qubic and its decentralised solutions.
- Qubican Developers – Contribute to Qubic’s technical ecosystem by assisting in development, writing code, and supporting open-source projects.
- Qubican Community Participants – Assist with community management, translations, outreach, and engagement activities to ensure Qubic’s message reaches new audiences and is effectively communicated.

Qubicans will play an important role in bringing more holders and developers to the Qubic ecosystem while also educating existing community members. 

### What are the expected outcomes?
- Support Qubic team with completing small impactful tasks such as code reviews, small design tasks, content writing, event planning (meetups, AMA’s and hackathons) and local community management. Some tasks will be linked directly to the bounty program
- Increased brand awareness and engagement within the crypto community
- Higher user and developer adoption of the Qubic ecosystem
- Growth in community-driven projects and initiatives
- Strengthened local communities with dedicated chapter leads

**Success Indicators**
- Number of ambassadors and local chapters established
- Number of tasks completed by ambassador program
- Number of developers onboarded into hackathons
- Number of community-driven projects initiated

### Review
We will review the first cohort (October - December) and continue if successful. 

### How will we spend the funds?
The requested funds are aimed to fuel the following initiatives within the Ambassador Program:
- Engagement activities like Zealy to creating campaigns and leadership boards
- Exclusive PFP’s for ambassador program that have shown proven impact
- Qubic Ambassador Reward Pool. **All Qubic ambassadors are expected to show proof of work before the actual payout. The payout are validated and overseen by the Qubic Team**
