## Details
Dear Community

As Qubic moves on with huge steps, the SteCo has renamed themselves to Qubic Core Services (QCS), Development in form of Qubic Core Tech (QCT) has already segregated from QCS, the QCS plans to have an Association in Switzerland, huge sums of Qu have been transferred to QCS and to QCT and also huge sums are planned to be sent to the new Board members of the Association which partly also are paid QCS members, many Quorum and community members are left with open questions.
To answer at least some of those questions from an independent point of view we hereby propose the Qubic Community Board (QCB). It will consist of community members that have been Qubic advocates for a long period of time, who have no direct operational roles within the ecosystem but possess a deep understanding of Qubic’s mission and community needs. 
This board will serve as an independent oversight body, guiding Qubic’s governance, auditing finances, reviewing the actions of the team members, evaluating the overall development and observing basically all official Qubic service and development entities. 
To support balanced governance, the QCB will have the authority to veto significant decisions and call for Quorum votes to solve those matters of substantial impact.
The QCB will have no active role in any decision making processes within projects, services and workgroups but will take on governance roles, providing independent oversight and auditing and will also create strategies that ensure a fair handling of all situations that could emerge when projects are in competition or new projects need funding so that all decisions are made for the best of Qubic.
The QSC will transition its governance activities to the QCB and will focus on its current operational roles, including workgroup leadership, project management and services. The QCB itself will be the long arm of the Quorum, it will inform the community regularly and will attend at meetings of the different projects and services on a regular basis to get a deeper understanding of the challenges while also ensuring balanced and structured governance and oversight models as Qubic continues to expand. 
The proposed QCB will consist of seven members: three elected by the Quorum, three by the Community, and one Chair elected by the QCB members themselves. We also want to see one or more by Quorum elected QCB members being part of the Associations Advisory Board. 
The QCB will initiate a process of continuous self reflection and observation to understand its lacks and its benefits, form strategies how its own and others actions can be evaluated, create visions for further Qubic expansion and try to keep healthy growth oriented governance. 
As part of this new governance framework the QCB will implement a robust escalation process outside of QCB and QCS. The escalation process will be held in 3 rounds where different trusted community members selected by QCB will have interviews with the persons/projects questioning decisions of all kinds, work out solutions and prevent possible conflicts of interest.
We welcome Community Managements attempts to solve conflicts with the community internally, but we feel the need of external counseling when it comes to team decision like banning or muting community members based on personal opinions. 
We additionally plan to fully separate moderation and administration from Community Management and the QCS, the QCB will launch a public community fund in parts supported by CCF to pay the salary of the moderation team in order to ensure that the moderation team stays as independent and neutral, allowing them to operate without bias or influence from any single entity. Administration can only remain in the hands of those project members that need discord access to pursue their mandates.  


We look forward to this new chapter with optimism, believing that these changes will create a balanced framework for Qubic’s sustainable and collaborative growth.


With gratitude,


Lex
