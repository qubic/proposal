## Summary

This proposal asks Computors to approve a comprehensive governance and funding framework that establishes:
- Clear structural roles, mandates, and reporting lines for all ecosystem entities
- Strict separation between three funds (CCF, Incubation Fund, Listing Fund)
- Independent financial oversight through a Finance Auditing Entity
- Protocol primacy ensuring technical integrity overrides governance decisions

## Background

The Qubic ecosystem has grown to include multiple workgroups, boards, and funding mechanisms. As operations have scaled, the need for formalized governance structures has become evident. This framework addresses:

1. **Structural Clarity** — Defining who does what, who reports to whom, and what authority each entity has
2. **Fund Separation** — Ensuring funds are isolated by purpose with distinct controls
3. **Accountability** — Establishing independent oversight and public transparency

## Framework Overview

### Fund Structure

| Fund | Purpose | Control |
|------|---------|---------|
| **CCF (Computor Controlled Fund)** | Funds Full Workgroups and approved Projects | Computor approval required |
| **Incubation Fund** | Dedicated to incubation projects only | Incubation Board |
| **Listing Fund** | Exchange listings only | Listing Board |

All three funds operate independently with strict isolation. Only CCF is subject to audit by the Finance Auditing Entity.

### Organizational Entities

**Full Workgroups** (funded by CCF):
- Marketing Workgroup
- Community Management Workgroup  
- Qubic Science Workgroup
- Tech Workgroup (with Protocol Primacy)

**Small Execution Workgroups** (funded by Full Workgroups):
- Business Development
- Incubation Management

**Strategy Layer Boards**:
- Strategic Board (WG Leads + Computor Delegates + Advisors) — defines strategic direction, first arbiter for conflicts
- Incubation Board — controls Incubation Fund, defines incubation program strategy
- Listing Board — controls Listing Fund, decides exchange strategy

**Oversight**:
- Finance Auditing Entity — independent oversight of CCF spending, mandatory access to financial records, public transparency

### Key Principles

1. **Fund Separation** — Funds strictly separated by purpose with distinct controls
2. **Decision vs Execution** — Boards decide direction; Workgroups execute
3. **Independent Oversight** — Financial oversight is independent and mandatory
4. **Protocol Primacy** — Protocol rules override all governance decisions; Tech Workgroup must refuse directives that violate protocol integrity

### Conflict Resolution

- **Standard conflicts**: Strategic Board → Computors (final authority)
- **Protocol conflicts**: Tech Workgroup → CFB → Protocol (governance cannot override protocol constraints)

|----------|-------------|
| **01_Qubic-Governance-Framework-Overview** | High-level overview — the essentials |
| **02_Qubic-Governance-Framework-Slides** | Presentation for deeper understanding |

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Period | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Phase 1** | Now → Mar 18 | Stakeholder alignment, community feedback, Computor approval |
| **Phase 2** | Feb → Apr | Entity establishment (Finance Auditing Entity, full Strategic Board) |
| **Phase 3** | Feb → May | Funding sustainability for Incubation and Listing funds |

**Key Milestones:**
- Feb 5, 2026: Stakeholder presentation
- Mar 11, 2026: Computor proposal
- Mar 18, 2026: Framework approval (target)
- Apr 15, 2026: All entities operational
- May 15, 2026: Fully operational with sustainable funding

## Current State

**Already Active (9 entities):**
- Computors, Tech Workgroup, Qubic Science, Marketing Workgroup
- Business Development, Incubation Management
- Incubation Board, Listing Board, Strategic Board (Interim)
- CCF with steady income (8% Computor donation)

**Gaps to Address:**
- Finance Auditing Entity (HIGH priority)
- Full Strategic Board with Computor delegates (MEDIUM priority)
- Sustainable funding for Incubation and Listing funds

## Benefits

✅ Clear accountability through defined roles and reporting lines  
✅ Financial discipline through fund separation and independent audit  
✅ Protocol protection through Tech Workgroup primacy  
✅ Decentralized governance with Computors as final authority  
✅ Transparent operations with public financial reporting  
✅ Scalable structure supporting ecosystem growth
